# 📈 Text Complexity and Stock Price Reactions

This project studies how the **length** and **complexity** of M&A (mergers & acquisitions) announcements affect **short-term stock market reactions**.  

It was created as part of a university project.

## 🔍 What I Did
- Collected company announcements and stock price data.  
- Measured **text length** and **text complexity** (readability).  
- Ran an **event study** around announcement dates.  
- Checked if text features explain abnormal stock returns.
